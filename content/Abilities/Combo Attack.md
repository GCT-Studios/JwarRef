If the Attack is successful then after resolving a Damage Roll, deduct 2 from the Success Level of the Attack.  
If the new Success Level is 0 or greater make another Damage Roll against the Defender.  
Repeat this process until the Success Level is less than 0.

If the Success Level of the original attack was 0 or 1, after resolving a Damage Roll, make one additional Damage Roll against the Defender at Success Level 0.

>[!NOTE]
>If a model has abilities that trigger when damage is caused each damage roll will trigger those abilities separately.
