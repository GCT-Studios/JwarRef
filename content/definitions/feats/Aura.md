![[Subject-Aura.png]] The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable.  
The area the Aura covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Aura’s area are affected.  
The model from which the Aura originates is always considered within the Aura.  
Auras last until the [[End Phase]] or until the originating model is removed from play if this is before the End Phase.
