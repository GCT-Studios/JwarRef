![[Subject-Pulse.png]]  The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable.  
The area the Pulse covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Pulse’s area are affected.  
The model from which the Pulse originates is always considered within the Pulse.  
A Pulse has no duration and ends as soon as the feat's effect has been resolved.
