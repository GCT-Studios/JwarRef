A model is Surprised if an Activating Enemy model that did not begin its activation in [[BtB]], performs an action that [[definitions/terms_concepts/Target]]s it or brings it into BtB and that Enemy model started outside of [[LoS]] and remains outside of LoS during [[Movement]].

Surprised models may not declare [[Ki Feats]] or [[Ki Boosts]], are always the Attacker second in [[Melee Exchange]]s, may not benefit from traits or effects that affect [[Initiative]] and suffer a -1 Melee Pool modifier.
They may still declare [[Special Abilities]] (Attacks and Defences).
Models are only Surprised until the action in which they became Surprised is resolved.
[[Effects]] which are not Ki Feats may still be used.
