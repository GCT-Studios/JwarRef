Tournament Organisers will appoint one or more Judges to answer rules questions.  
During a Tournament, the Judge is the final authority on any rules issues.  
For larger events it may be necessary to have a Head Judge and several Judges.  
Any event with more than one Judge should appoint a Head Judge so there is one final authority on the day.
