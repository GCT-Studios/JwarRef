If a model has a Blind Marker it cannot draw [[LoS]] outside of [[BtB]] and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier during [[Melee Exchange]].

Blind models may not declare a[[Run Action]] or a [[Charge Action]].

During the [[End Phase]] remove all Blind markers from each model with any Blind Markers.

Models with [[Sixth Sense]] automatically have [[Immune]] [Blind].
