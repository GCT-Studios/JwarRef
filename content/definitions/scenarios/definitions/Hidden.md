Each player secretly selects one of their models as the VIM. That model loses the [[Flank]] trait and [[Disguised]] state, and cannot gain them.
This is [[Open-Hidden Information|Hidden Information]].
This is not revealed to your Opponent until the End Phase of the last Turn of the game. Players donâ€™t declare when the VIM is killed but note in which Turn each of their models were killed (This may be used as a tie-breaker in some variants).
