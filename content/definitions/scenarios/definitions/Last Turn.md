Any reference to the last Turn for scoring refers to:
- Fixed Game Length: the final Turn a game could reach (usually 6)
- Variable Game Length: the Turn that has been determined to be the last Turn by dice roll

If the game ends earlier (e.g. due to one player having no models remaining in play) then no last Turn took place, so no scoring for that last turn applies.
