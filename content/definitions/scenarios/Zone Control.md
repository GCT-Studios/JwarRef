In these scenarios there are areas on the battlefield which the players must battle to Control. A player Controls a Zone if, completely within its area, they have both:
• more models than their Opponent
• a higher Rice Cost of models than their Opponent

> [!NOTE]
> The Rice Cost printed on the card is used, regardless of Enhancements, discounts etc.
> If two models are considered the same model when making a Warband, use the Rice Cost printed on whichever card has a Rice Cost.
> If two or more models are bought for a rice cost (usually written “X for Both”) then each model is one model as usual, but both (or all) models must be in the same Zone to contribute Rice Cost towards controlling that Zone.

A player gains a number of Scenario Points defined by the Alignment of the Zone during the End Phase.
In Masters scenarios, Zones are 4” or 8” diameter circles, with the layout detailed in the scenario.
