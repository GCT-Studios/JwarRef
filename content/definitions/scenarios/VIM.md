These are models that a player must kill, capture, or defend depending on whether it is theirs or their Opponentâ€™s.  
If a Warband contains no legal model to be VIM then it is considered to have had its VIM killed on Turn 1 for VP scores.  
In scenarios, if a model nominated as a VIM leaves play and returns, it is no longer considered a VIM.  
Players should nominate VIMs during Game Setup. If two models are considered to be the same model when recruiting a Warband then, if chosen as VIM, both models are considered to be VIM.  

> [!example]
> Example: Kota's Human Form is chosen as a VIM, if she is replaced with her Fox Form then Kota's Fox Form is still the VIM.

The Tournament Pack may define the variant, in brackets, after the Type:
e.g. Type: VIM (Hidden)

Otherwise, players can choose or randomly decide.  

There are some requirements on which models can be selected:
- Unique
- not [[Insignificant]]
- not Animal Types

If the scenario requires more than one VIM this will also appear in brackets after the Type:
e.g. Type: 2 VIM (Hidden and Open)

![[Hidden]]
