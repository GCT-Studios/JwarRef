## Scenario Objective Interactions
Players can interact with Scenario Objectives by taking Simple or Complex Scenario Actions, listed in brackets after the Interaction: e.g. Influence (Simple).  
The effect of an action depends on the Interactions of the scenario. If there is more than one Interaction available to the model then the controlling player decides which to use.  
Only those Interactions outlined in a scenario can be used. The Interactions will appear as keywords:

![[Influence]]

![[Prayer]]
