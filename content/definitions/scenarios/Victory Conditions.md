Each scenario has three VPs available to the players. At the end of the game the player who has scored the highest number of VPs is the winner.  
If both players have scored an equal number of VPs then the game is a draw. Only 3 VPs can be scored in any scenario, so both players VP scores combined will always be three or less.  
If the scenario has multiple scoring options and the order is relevant, resolve scoring in the following order:
1. Scenario Influence, including Decreasing removals.
2. Scenario Points, including Decreasing removals.
3. VIMs.
