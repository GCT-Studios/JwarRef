If the Attack is successful, move the Defender 1” directly away from the Attacker, then move the Attacker 1” directly towards the Defender.  
The Defender suffers half the wounds from the Damage Roll caused by this Attack.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> ![[special-forceback_attack.webp]]
> Akio is the attacking model.  
> The defender is moved 1” directly away from the attacker.  
> The attacker is then moved directly forward into BtB with the defender.  
> After the Damage roll, the Damage is halved (rounding down).
