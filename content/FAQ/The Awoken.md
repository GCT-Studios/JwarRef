**Webbed Victims:** Ki generation doesn't stack when in BtB with 2 victims. You can only ever profit from one of them.

**Trap Door Web:**
*Lightning Reflexes* **does** change the Initiative in the unique Melee Exchange. _Reach_ **does not** (it requires the enemy to enter BtB).
"No model is surprised" also supersedes "auto-surprise" effects.
Both models are exhausted and lose 1 die. This is intended.
The Trap Door Melee does not require a Fear Test.
The interaction with [[Camouflage]] and [[Disguise]] is still being discussed. The fact the Kumo cannot use Ki feats while the enemy can also. **For now, play this by RAW:** Trap Door Melee circumvents Camouflage and Disguise and breaks the Disguised state.
