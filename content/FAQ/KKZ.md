**Q: Can the KKZ Worm ability "Kohai" be used to duplicate feats gained from special cards?**
A: No. You may only duplicate feats physically on the card.

**Q: Can the Skirmish Mission theme allow me to exceed the Max value of Enhancements or Terrain special cards?**
A: No. While this is technically after the warband recruitment, restrictions will still apply.

**Q: Can Axiam use Special Attacks gained from his Unique Effect on Ranged Weapons.**
A: No.

**Q: Phantom's and Spectre's ability to [[Summon]] the other of the pair and replace themselves with the Summoned one has different wording, is this correct?**
A: Yes, this is correct. If you recruited Phantom (either alone or together with Spectre), Spectre cannot Summon Phantom. Phantom can always Summon Spectre if Spectre is not yet or no longer in play. Their ability to swap places on the battlefield is not affected by this. 

**Q: If Phantom or Spectre [[Summon]] the other of the pair, how much health does the Summoned model have?**
A: They have exactly as much health as they had the last time they were in play in this match. If they haven't yet been in play or have been killed previously, they appear with full health. Using this swap does not heal or add damage to the wound track.
  
**Q: How are Activation Counters actually handled when Phantom or Spectre [[Summon]] the other of the pair?**
A: Removing the Summoning model from play ends their activation and they lose an Activation Counter. The Summoned model then receives the remaining Activation Counters. The Summoned model does not immediately activate. Effectively, the Summoning was the complete activation. Their ability to swap places on the battlefield is not affected by this, the active model remains active and continues their activation.

**Q: Who is the origin for the [[Damage Roll]] from Spectre's unique effect?**
A: Spectre is the origin for this damage roll, so Spectre's weapon, modifiers and Traits apply to this damage roll.

**Q: State Markers are not transferred over when Phantom or Spectre [[Summon]] the other of the pair, what happens to these Markers? **
A: Models that are not in play cannot have Markers, so all Markers are removed if the model leaves play.
