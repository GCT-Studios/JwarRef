**Q: The Knife Enhancement - Equipment card can be used by Crabs but Animals and Swarms cannot have special cards attached. How does this work?**
A: The text allowing the crabs to have the card should reference the Enhancement rule preventing these types from using the card, thus has priority. All types of Crab model may use the knife regardless of Animal/Swarm type.
