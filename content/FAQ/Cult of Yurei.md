**Q: On Umeka's Feat, Curse of Stinging Needles" Is the -1 in [[Tough]] (-1) a modifier or a number?**
A: Modifier. It does stack, including with itself. If we ever have something gain a negative value trait, we'll word it differently.

**Q: Can I use the Spirit Defence Ritual on a Yuta to get one Ki Feat for free once?**
A: No, the wounds aren't marked so no benefit is gained.

**Q: For Crush The Oppressed are additional [[Controlled]] Markers added or, since more Controlled Markers are added, do they get removed?**
A: Control Markers are not added, they are doubled so you will end up with twice as many, not all cancelled out.
