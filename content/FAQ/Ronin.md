**Q: Can a Giant Eagle or Eagle of the Jwar Isles use their Unique Effects to go into [[Flank]] and then [[Deploy]] during the same turn?**
A: Yes. The player chooses the order to resolve their Starting Phase effects, so they can choose to use the Unique Effect and then deploy any Flank models for the turn.
