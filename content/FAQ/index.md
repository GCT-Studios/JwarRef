**Q: Are "Required" and Requirement" the same thing on Special Cards?**
A: Yes these mean the same thing.

**Q: When an enemy model is surprising one of my models, when exactly does it become surprised? When is the last time I could use a Ki Feat?**
A: As soon as a model's action is declared (as long as it will bring the model into BtB or qualifies for surprise under the relevant rules), the target/chosen model should be considered Surprised and their Ki feat window closed.
The last time you can use a Ki Feat is before the declaration of the action. It is perfectly acceptable for the active player to say "I am going to declare an action, do you want to use a Ki Feat before I do?" to prevent any timing issues.

**Q: Do passive unique effects continue on models that are removed from play?**
A: Passive abilities only work while the model is in play.

**Q: Are [[Melee Exchange]] tiebreak for most dice rolled by attack/ defence or all dice together?**
A: All dice.

**Q: At the start of a [[Melee Exchange]] both models turn to face, is this considered movement?**
A: No

**Q: How does the [[Believer]] trait work with feats that cost X?**
A: When declaring the use of the feat, declare what X will be then use X-1 to determine the cost of the feat. Gain the benefit of the feat at X as written.

**Q: What happens if I use the Curse Fate feat while the Balance event has been played?**
A: The dice cannot be re-rolled so remove any duplicates, those are lost.

**Q: For the feats Hold the Line, Pile On!, and Sister's Succour what does "Attempt to reach [[BtB]]" mean?**
A: If a model cannot reach [[BtB]] with the enemy model, this feat cannot be used.

**Q: What happens to Activation Counters if I gain the [[Flank]] trait mid game?**
A: When a model is "Deployed" it has no Activation counters. Flank will add two as usual.

**Q: Do multiple instances of [[Co-ordinated Attack]] stack?**
A: Yes, the modifier is given as +1 so they stack as long as the Co-ordinated Attack traits are all satisfied. Multiple models do not trigger the benefit from one Co-ordinated Attack multiple times.

**Q: How do [[Rise]] and [[Last Stand]] on the same model work?**
A: When your model gets reduced to 0 wounds, you can choose which trait to activate first.
- If you succeed at the Rise test at this point, your health is reset and Last Stand cannot be activated. If you fail, then feel free to activate Last Stand.
- If you trigger Last Stand first, the Rise will have no effect (Last Stand prevents healing/wound recovery/any way to get wounds back). The mechanics of this means that yes, you could roll the Rise test after declaring Last Stand, but if you succeed, you remain at 0 wounds - so you die (again).

**Q: Does a model using the Deadeye feat ignore [[Camouflage]]?**
A: Yes, since a model must be "Benefitting" from Cover to gain Camouflage if a model ignores Cover (Or ignores Cover modifiers) it will ignore Camouflage.

**Q: What happens if two (or more) models in a Warband are affected by Fog of Hesitation?**
A: Once all other models have used their Activation Counters, the affected models may activate as normal.

**Q: What happens if a model with [[Flank]] cannot [[Deploy]] on the Flank turn?**
A: They stay Elsewhere until some other trait or effect can bring them back to the board. 

**Q: If I used War Weary and then deploy a model with [[Flank]] on the same turn, do they get 2 Activation Counters?**
A: No, War Weary states its duration: “In the first turn”, so models coming in with Flank will still only get a single Activation Counter.

**Q: Can a [[Kami]] spend Ki Tokens to reduce itself to 0 Ki?**
A: No.

**Q: How does [[Assassin]] work in conjunction with [[Strong]] or [[Weak]]?**
A: Assassin trumps either trait. Technically the player would choose which trait to resolve first, but there is no reason not to choose Assassin if able as the quantity of damage dice is specified and would not change due to the addition of Strong or Weak.

**Q: Can you declare a [[Charge]] where only the movement over [[Ideal]] terrain in the charge path will give you enough movement to reach the charge target? **
A: Yes.

**Q: Do I have to roll any dice to take advantage of [[Brutal]]/[[Parry]]/[[Resistance]]?**  
A: Yes.  Similarly if all dice roll 1s, you cannot benefit from these traits.
> [!NOTE]
> Previously this was different for each trait; this should be simpler overall.

**Q: When an effect adds terrain to the Battlefield, does it last until the End Phase?**  
A: No, terrain is not “An Effect” and so is only removed when explicitly stated, so it will remain for the rest of the game if no condition for removal is given.
