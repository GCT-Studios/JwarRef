The Honbasho Format is a fast and deadly version of Bushido where, much like two Iaijutsu Masters facing off against each other, the first player to make a mistake often loses.  
This is not the cerebral, tactical play of a Masters tournament, winners at Honbasho must be able to act on instinct and make the most out of very little time.

> [!warning]
> This scenario is usually played as part of a Honbasho-only tournament, and not included in a Master format event.
## Event Rules
### Warband Composition
Each player brings a 100 Rice list with at least one valid VIM.
### Round Timings
The length of each round in Honbasho is 60 minutes. 
### Player Timings
Each player has 30 Seconds to declare their activating model and what action it will take.  
After 30 seconds, if a player has chosen a model but has not declared an action, that model loses an activation counter.  
If the player has not chosen a model, their opponent removes an activation counter from any model.  
Play passes to the opponent.
### Terrain Deployment
The tournament organiser should decide what terrain is placed on each table, how it is set up and clearly explain to the players of the tournament how each piece should be interpreted. Players should not move the terrain during a game or in between rounds. At the start of each round players should still make a Tactical Test to determine who chooses the deployment zone and then deploys their Warband.
