When this model successfully Damages an Opponent in a Melee Exchange, after the Melee Exchange is resolved, Place this model anywhere within 1" of the Enemy model and not in its LoS or within a [[Spirit]] Ward Aura (If this is not possible this feat cannot be used).
If this model has a remaining Activation Counter after this activation is completed, you may become the Active Player again and begin this model's activation.
