Deploy a Makibishi terrain element template in BtB with this model.
Whenever a model without [[Cloudwalk]] or [[Intangible]] moves into, or starts its movement within the Makibishi terrain element, it must make a Walk Challenge Test (8) if it is performing a Charge or Run Action, or Walk Challenge Test (7) otherwise.
If unsuccessful the model's movement and activation immediately ends.
