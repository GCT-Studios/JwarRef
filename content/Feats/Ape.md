When another Friendly Monk model in the pulse ends its activation you may become the Active Player again and begin this model's activation.
If you do, this model must declare the same action as that Monk and gains a Non-Exceptional, Special Attack or Defence from that Monk until the action is complete.
If the cost of the Special is 0 it becomes 1.
