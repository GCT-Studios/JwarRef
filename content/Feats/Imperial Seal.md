When this model is Targeted with a Ki Feat or Action by an Enemy non-[[Soulless]], non-[[Insignificant]], non-Animal model, the Opposing Player must choose a different valid Target for the Action or Ki Feat.
If there is no other legal Target then the Enemy model's action ends. Remove an Activation Counter as normal.
