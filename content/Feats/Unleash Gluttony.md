Summon and Deploy a Gluttony within 2" of this model. It may not be placed in an Enemy model's ZoC or in BtB with an Enemy model.
Place a number of Ki Tokens on Gluttony's profile card equal to the number spent for this Ki Feat instead of any from the [[Kami]] trait when deployed.
There may only be one Friendly Gluttony in play at any time.
This model cannot use this Ki Feat if there is already a Friendly Gluttony in play.
