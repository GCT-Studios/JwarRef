When this model declares a Ranged Attack Action choose one of the following until the current Ranged Attack Action is resolved:
- This model's Cannon Weapon gains [[Slam Attack]] (0).
- Draw a line between this model and the Target model. Any model the line crosses and any model within 1" of those models gain an [[On Fire]] (2) Marker.
- If the attack is successful, centre a 2" Pulse on the Target model. Models within the Pulse suffer a Damage Roll with the same Success Level as the Target model and gain a [[Stunned]] Marker.
