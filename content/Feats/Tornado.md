When a Friendly model within 2" is the Target of a failed Ranged Attack, immediately make a Ranged Attack.
The Range Bands, Strength bonus and any applicable traits or unique effects on the model which failed the Ranged Attack are used instead of any such traits or effects on this model.
This model ignores the effects of [[Ammo]] and [[Reload]] traits while resolving this Ki Feat.
