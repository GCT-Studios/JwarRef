When a Friendly Onisho model deals damage in a Melee Exchange in the Pulse, if this model is not in BtB or an Enemy model's ZoC, once the Melee Exchange is resolved this model may immediately Charge the Enemy model.
Neither model loses Activation Counters for this Charge or for participating in the Melee Exchange.
If the Enemy model is removed from play only this model may use the Consume Soul Ki Feat this activation.
