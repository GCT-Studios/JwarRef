When an Enemy model without [[Cloudwalk]] or [[Intangible]], and not in BtB with a Friendly model, declares a Walk in the Pulse, that model must make a Walk Challenge Test (X).
X is 8 for models declaring a Run or Charge Action. X is 7 otherwise.
If it fails the model may not Walk; if it was declaring an action, it loses an Activation Counter and its action is considered resolved.
This is a Trap effect.
