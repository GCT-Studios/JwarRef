When an Enemy non-Samurai, non-Ashigaru model declares an action which will either bring it into BtB with this model, or Targets this model with a Ranged Attack or Ki Feat, it must make a Challenge (5) Ki Test.
If the Enemy model is successful resolve the Action as normal.
If unsuccessful its activation ends before any movement and it removes an Activation Counter.
This is a Trap effect.
