When a Friendly model in the Pulse is selected for a Melee Action or targeted by a Charge Action, this model becomes the new selected or targeted model.
If the Enemy model has enough movement to reach the original model, it is instead moved into BtB with this model by the shortest route, regardless of its actual movement.
