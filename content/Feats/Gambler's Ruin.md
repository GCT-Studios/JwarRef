Until the End Phase, when Target model performs a Test, their Controller rolls an additional die.
This model's Controller must remove a dice of their choice from that Test before it is resolved.
For a Melee Exchange, this occurs after dice allocation is revealed.
The additional dice may be Attack or Defence and the removed dice must be of the same type.
