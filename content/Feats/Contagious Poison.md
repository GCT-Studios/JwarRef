Perform an Opposed Ki test with Target Enemy Model. If successful, that model gains a [[Poisoned]] (2) Marker and a [[Stunned]] Marker.
Regardless of success of the Opposed Ki Test, choose another Enemy model within 3" of the Target and immediately repeat this Ki Feat at no cost on the chosen model, ignoring Range, LoS, and [[Camouflage]].
The chosen model is then considered the Target.
No model may be affected more than once by this Ki Feat in a turn.
