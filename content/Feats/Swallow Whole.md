This feat must be declared before Initiative is determined in a Melee Exchange. If this model's Attack is successful, place the Enemy model Elsewhere.
Affected Enemy models suffer one Wound (ignoring [[Tough]]) if they are Elsewhere in the End Phase. For each Wound taken, this model gains 1 Ki Token.
When this model is removed from play for any reason, first place any affected models in BtB with this model. If this model is not on the Battlefield when it is removed from play, affected models gain [[Flank]] and return to play using that rule.
