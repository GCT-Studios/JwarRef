Until the end of the current activation, if Target other Bakemono must make a [[Disguised]] or [[Fear Challenge Test]], this model makes the Test instead.
Target model may attempt the [[Disguised]] Test as if it had Ki Stat 2 or higher. While making Tests for the Target, this model gains [[Bravery]] and loses [[Cowardly]].
