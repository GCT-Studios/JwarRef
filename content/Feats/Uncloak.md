Use this feat in the Starting Phase or when this model is targeted by an enemy effect or a model declares an action or resolves an effect that will bring it into BtB with this model while this model is undamaged.

Replace this model with a Loyal Samurai you own that is currently Elsewhere, and place this model Elsewhere.
This model gains the [[Flank]] trait and returns to play using those rules.
If the Enemy Model initiated a Melee Exchange, it is now Surprised.
