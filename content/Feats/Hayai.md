While this model is involved in a Melee Exchange, your Opponent may not use Instant or Active Effects.
This effect ends once the current activation is complete.
This feat always resolves before other Instant or Active Effects, regardless of the usual Active Player Rules Conflict resolution and can be used to prevent an Enemy model using a declared feat (No Enemy resources are expended).
