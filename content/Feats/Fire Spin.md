Walk this model 4" in a straight line in any direction. Any model within 2" of this model at any point in its path gains an [[On Fire]] (2) Marker.
Until the End Phase, whilst this model is in play, models making Ranged Attacks suffer a +1 modifier to the Challenge Number of Ranged Attack Tests.
In the next Starting Phase, the player who wins the Tactical Test moves this model 4" in a straight line in any direction, then the other player moves him 2" in a straight line in any direction. Any model within 2" of this model at any point in its path gains an [[On Fire]] (2) Marker then this effect ends.
