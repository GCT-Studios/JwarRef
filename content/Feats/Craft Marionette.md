Summon and Deploy a Marionette anywhere within 2" of this model and not in an Enemy model's ZoC. The Marionette receives a number of Ki Tokens equal to the X spent instead of any from the [[Kami]] trait when deployed.
This model cannot use 'Craft Marionette' if there is already a Marionette in this Warband.
