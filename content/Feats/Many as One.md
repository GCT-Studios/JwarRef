Summon and Deploy a Sagoya Kaidan within 3" of Target Enemy model.
It may not be placed in an Enemy model's ZoC or in BtB with an Enemy model.
Place a number of Ki Tokens on Sagoya Kaidan's profile card equal to the number spent for this Ki Feat instead of any from the [[Kami]] trait when deployed.
There may only be one Friendly Sagoya Kaidan in play at any time.
This model cannot use this Ki Feat if there is already a Friendly Sagoya Kaidan in play.
