When a Friendly model causes a [[Kami]] to be removed from play in a Melee Exchange while in the Aura, you may replace the [[Kami]] by Summoning and Deploying a Friendly, 8 Rice Cost, [[Kami]] with identical Elemental Icons (if the Enemy [[Kami]] has no Elemental Icons, you may replace it with a Lesser Void [[Kami]]).
