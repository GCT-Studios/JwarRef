Make a Ranged Attack, ignoring [[Reloading]] Markers and the [[Reload]] Trait.
On a successful attack, choose an Izu Serpent model that is not currently in play.
Before you make the Damage Roll, the Target suffers the following in addition to the Ranged Damage roll:
- Asp: [[Poisoned]] (2) Marker
- Boa Constrictor: [[Immobilised]] Marker
- Cobra: [[Blind]] Marker
Once the attack is resolved, if the attack was successful, Deploy the chosen Izu Serpent model in BtB with the Target model, ignoring the usual BtB restriction on Deploying a model.
