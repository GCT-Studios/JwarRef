## Logistics
The TO should arrange for enough terrain to cover all tables used for an event with the appropriate amount of terrain. They should allow enough time during the day between rounds for players to move their models, use the toilet, get refreshments, and socialise.  
## Judges
It is advised that the TO recruit a Judge; someone with good rules knowledge and an ability to be impartial, especially if they are not confident about the rules themselves. TOs can always contact GCT and we can look for a Retainer Volunteer in their area.  
For local events this may not be necessary as at more casual events it is quite common for difficult rules issues to be solved with help from players at neighbouring tables.  One person, however, should be appointed Judge to make final decisions, and official answers can be sought after the event.  
## Records
We have provided a record sheet to make drawing each round easy, this is also available as a separate PDF.  We do recommend having some tournament software, GCT require all Grand Masters events to use Longshanks tournament software.  Longshanks has a Bushido option and is set up to run Masters Format events.
