## Logistics
Players should bring all their own models, profile cards, dice, measuring devices, markers, and templates they require for play.  
Players should have all the current, official profile cards for the models in their Warbands and must show a profile card, or the relevant rules from the Errata or Rulebook as appropriate, if requested by their opponent.  
Players are responsible for checking the accuracy of any list-building app they use. These helpful tools should not be relied on for ensuring list validity.  

## Warband lists
Players should bring two copies of their list: one for the TO and one to show to their opponent before each game begins.  

**Models & profiles:**  
All models used in GCT organised play events must be GCT miniatures from the Bushido the game range. The miniatures must be fully assembled on the correctly-sized base for which the model was designed, and the base marked for Facing and Line of Sight. Any nonâ€“GCT models, unassembled miniatures, or inappropriately based models are not permitted.  

Profile cards and special cards that have not yet been released to the general public at the time of the event are not permitted unless they are readily available at the event venue (such as a convention release). This need not be a retail release; only models & cards which have been sold to a limited group (such as volunteer models, or models that have never been on sale) are prohibited. This never applies to re-sculpts, which are permitted so long as the profile card has been released publicly.

## Model conversions
Players must be unambiguous about model representation. At their discretion, the TO can make exceptions to approve any reasonable conversion. A converted model must contain a majority of parts from the original model for which the rules were written. The end result of any conversion must be clearly identifiable as the intended miniature and accurately represent it. Any conversions must be clearly pointed out to the opponent before each game to avoid confusion.  

## Sportsmanship
Fair and honest game experiences are required in order for everyone to have a fun event. Players must execute the rules of the game accurately, and fully cooperate with opponents to honestly answer any questions that arise before and during games.  
Players are responsible for holding their opponents to the same standards.  

Judges will not be able to observe every game. If your opponent is doing something that is making you uncomfortable - stalling, bending the rules, or outright cheating then tell your opponent about it. Explain what they can do to remedy the situation in order to maintain a fair, honest, and fun game environment. If the behaviour continues, or a dispute arises, call a Judge and explain the situation. The Judge always has the final word on rules questions or debates. Players must accept all rulings made by the Judge whether they agree or not.  

## Cocked dice
Any dice that are not totally flat on the surface of the table should be rolled again until they are.
This is not considered a re-roll for game purposes; the roll is not complete until the dice shows a clear result flat on the table.
