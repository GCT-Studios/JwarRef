Before starting the first Turn, players need to set up the game using the following steps. This replaces the relevant sections of the Rulebook.
1. Players move to their assigned table and share their Warband list with their Opponent.
2. Players make any list-composition changes permitted.
3. Players deploy any Scenario Objectives and Zones as instructed by the scenario.
4. Players make a Deployment Tactical Test. Winner chooses to be Player 1 or 2.
5. If the TO is setting table terrain, skip to step 6.
	1. Player 1 sets up the first terrain element.
	2. Players then alternate choosing & deploying terrain elements until at least six are deployed.
	3. They may continue adding more terrain elements after this but, if one player chooses to stop, the other may only deploy up to one more terrain piece.
	   Players have 5 minutes to setup terrain.
6. Player 2 chooses one of the Deployment Zones as dictated by the scenario.
7. Player 1 decides who will deploy their Warband Terrain first, then alternating between players until all Warband Terrain has been deployed.
8. Players simultaneously Declare or Record any VIMs.
9. The player that was chosen to deploy their Warband terrain first also first deploys their entire Warband as detailed by the scenario.
   The other player then deploys their entire Warband as detailed by the scenario.
   See the [[Scout]] and [[Flank]] traits for deployment exceptions.
10. The first turn begins.
