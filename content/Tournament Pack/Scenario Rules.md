Bushido is best enjoyed by playing a scenario. Whilst beating your opponent into the ground until the last man is standing is fun, especially when learning the rules, there will come a time when you want to explore the full strategically challenging potential that Bushido has to offer.
Scenarios are named and then broken down into five simple sections, that when understood allow players to quickly pick up and play any scenario.
## Name
Thematic title purely to add to the cinematic experience that a game of Bushido brings.
Type: All scenarios have one or more Types:
- Objectives
- Very Important Models (VIM)
- Zone Control
Types are linked to the scoring of Victory Points (VPs) in scenarios. How this is achieved is dependent on the scenario and is explained under its Victory Conditions.
## Deployment
Where to deploy your models and any Scenario Objectives. If the scenario presents a choice then for a single game determine randomly, at an event the TO will announce what type is being used.
## Game Length
The number of turns the game will last. 
## Scenario Objective Interactions
How models interact with any Scenario Objectives.
## Victory Conditions
How the players ultimately win a game by scoring Victory Points.
## Scenario Points
Used by some scenarios to decide a Victory Point.
## Alignment
Scenario Objectives and Zones are one of three Alignments (Friendly, Neutral or Enemy).
This can be shown on the battlefield by turning the Scenario Objective to face the playerâ€™s Deployment Zone to whom it is Friendly, and to face neither player when it is Neutral. 
If a Scenario Objective is Friendly to a player then his Opponent considers it Enemy.
When scoring Scenario Points according to the Alignment of a Zone or Scenario Objective, score as follows:

| Alignment | Scenario Points |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Friendly  | 1               |
| Neutral   | 2               |
| Enemy     | 3               |
