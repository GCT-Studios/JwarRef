These 12 scenarios are suitable for Tournament play.  
At a tournament the TO will choose scenarios.  
For pick-up games, you can generate a scenario randomly:
- Roll D6 or choose to use Basic or Advanced
- Roll D6 to determine the scenario
Alternatively you can randomly determine a scenario of a given type quite easily using the tables provided. Any method to randomly determine a scenario is fine, provided both players are clear on the method. If you have a D12 to hand, you can simply use that.  
Some TOs like to roll each scenario live in front of the players, this creates a fun moment of tension but make sure you have the required zones or objectives for any given scenario!  

>[!NOTE]
>In the following Scenario diagrams the position of Scenario Objectives is measured to their centre point, whereas the position of Zones is measured to their edges.
>All elements which can be Friendly, Neutral, or Enemy are coloured blue, yellow, or red, respectively.
