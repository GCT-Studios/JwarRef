When players are deploying terrain, these rules apply to all terrain placed before the game begins. This replaces the relevant sections of the Rulebook.  
Terrain need not keep any distance from the edge of the table but must be at least 3” from any deployment zone.  
Very large terrain pieces (like houses) can be placed partially on the table to keep them from dominating the battlefield.  
## Pool Terrain
Terrain elements provided by the TO form a pool from which the players choose elements to Deploy.  
All Pool Terrain must be at least 3” from any other Pool Terrain in addition to the usual rules for terrain setup.  
## Warband Terrain
Terrain recruited into a Warband, as the result of a terrain card, theme benefit, unique effect, or any card recruited into the Warband.  
Warband Terrain may not be placed overlapping other terrain at this point, but Terrain deployed during the game is not restricted in this way.  
## Restricted Terrain
Impassable Terrain Elements and those Elements deemed unsuitable for models to end their movement on (e.g. “Void Rifts”, walls) are additionally termed Restricted Terrain.  

No Restricted Terrain may be deployed within a Scenario or Deployment Zone.  
No Restricted Terrain may be deployed within 3” of a Scenario Objective.
