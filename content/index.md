> [!NOTE] Note for nerds
> The [source files](https://github.com/GCT-Studios/JwarRef) are created using Obsidian, the Markdown editor, and make use of YAML frontmatter for supporting file properties such as feat details.  
> This site is intended as both a simple supporting resource for discussion and games, and as an example of what can be done with the source rules.  
> Check out the tools section of the Bushido Discord server if you want to know more.
