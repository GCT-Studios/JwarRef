# JwarRef
A rules repository and knowledgebase for GCT Studio's Bushido tabletop miniatures skirmish game.  
This auto-generated site will eventually contain all content from the Rulebook, every Ki Feat, the Tournament & Scenario Pack, Profiles, and the Official FAQ.  
This isnâ€™t intended to replace any existing community resources, but to complement them.  
Any developers looking for the rules text and definitions, please look in the [content](https://github.com/GCT-Studios/JwarRef/tree/v4/content) folder.
